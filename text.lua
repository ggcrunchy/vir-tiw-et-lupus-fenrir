		The fearsome Fenris-wolf ravages the land!

		Twice the Aesir have bound it in chains; twice it has
		shucked them away. It now terrorizes the countryside.

		The great warrior Tiw, seeking glory in battle, longs to
		rush headlong against the fell beast. But the Aesir urge
		PRUDENCE upon his doughty arm.

		The dwarves conceive a plan. Gather six impossible things:
		the footfalls of a cat, the beard of a woman, a mountain's
		roots, the sinews of a bear, a bird's spittle, the breath
		of a fish. With these components, they will forge the tough
		ribbon Gleipnir, by which mighty Fenrir may be bound.

		Tiw goes off in search!

		(Move with the cursor keys or the arrows. Collect the six
		named ingredients.)
	]],

	-- Fortitudo --
	[[
		In Ni√∞avellir the dwarves fashion the patches of Gleipnir.

		Yet Fenrir will not simply stay put to be muzzled!

		"Let us strike a deal," says he, "As surety, have Tiw place
		his fierce hand deep in my maw. Then I will let these dwarves
		play their tricks."

		Fenrir can crush great stones with his mighty jaws. Tiw's
		heart quails! But he musters his FORTITUDE.

		(Press on! Move up and down with the cursor keys or arrows,
		collecting greenish orbs to maintain your fortitude. Stave off
		panic attacks by clicking / tapping red orbs when they appear.)
	]],

	-- Iustitita --
	[[
		Tiw is now at Fenrir's mercy, with his great hand lodged
		deep in the beast's gullet.

		The dwarves stand ready to weave Gleipnir, but concern
		for the warrior stays their hands. Though Tiw's	own heart
		misgives him, JUSTICE demands that the deed be done. Give
		them the order!

		But cruel Loki will not let his beastly son be so easily
		bound. His own dark agents attack from the shadows, trying
		to unravel Gleipnir ere the patchwork is complete!

		(Click / tap on the dwarves when they appear to have
		them add a patch to Gleipnir. Likewise, do the same to
		deflect Loki's blades!)
	]],

	-- Temperantia --
	[[
		"CRUNCH!"

		Fenrir is bound, but clamps down his jaws. Tiw's hand
		is shorn off! His screams ring out through the land.

		The dwarves bring him a mighty potable, Dwarf Soda, to
		fend off the terrible agony. With abandon, they send
		bottle after bottle his way.

		But Tiw has now had plenty! Rather than calm him,
		too much more will send him into a berserker rage,
		where he will rival Fenrir in his destruction. The
		Aesir must now impose involuntary TEMPERANCE on
		Tiw, until until the fury subsides!

		(Click / tap bottles to keep them from Tiw's lips!)
	]],

	-- Ending --
	[[
		The Aesir have checked the Dwarves, and in time Tiw
		settles down... sore, but calm.

		Odin augurs cruel tidings yet to come from Fenrir. But
		for now, peace has returned to the land.
